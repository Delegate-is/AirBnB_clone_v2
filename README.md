## Background
The AirBnB Clone - MySQL project is a professional implementation of an AirBnB clone that utilizes MySQL as the database management system. This project emphasizes the use of environment variables for configuration purposes. It provides an opportunity to learn about unit testing, handling arguments, creating and configuring MySQL databases, working with ORM, and utilizing environment variables effectively.

## Resources
Before starting this project, it is recommended to review the following resources:

- [cmd module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html)
- [Python packages concept page](https://realpython.com/python-modules-packages/)
- [unittest module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
- [args/kwargs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#arbitrary-argument-lists)
- [SQLAlchemy tutorial](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/tutorial/index.html)
- [How To Create a New User and Grant Permissions in MySQL](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-new-user-and-grant-permissions-in-mysql)
- [Python3 and environment variables](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.environ)
- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
- [MySQL 8.0 SQL Statement Syntax](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-syntax.html)

## Objectives
- Implement unit testing in a large project
- Understand and utilize *args and **kwargs
- Handle named arguments effectively
- Create and configure MySQL databases
- Set up MySQL users and privileges
- Work with Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
- Map Python classes to MySQL tables
- Handle different storage engines using the same codebase
- Utilize environment variables for configuration

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd AirBnB_clone_v2
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```

   ```

## Usage
1. Set up the required environment variables (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for details).

2. Run the main application:
   ```
   python console.py
   ```

3. Use the command-line interface to interact with the AirBnB clone. Manage properties, users, places, and bookings using the provided commands and options.

## Environment Variables
This project relies on the following environment variables:

- **HBNB_ENV**: The running environment. Set it to either "dev" or "test" (with "production" coming soon!).
